#Exercise 5
#This is a program to compute and provide the area of a cine

#line 5 asks for the radius from the user and turns it into a float
r=float(input("Enter the radius of the cone:"))

#line 8 asks for the height of the cone from the user and turns it into a float
h=float(input("Enter the height of the cone:"))

#the below is establishing a value for pi
pi=3.14159

print(("v=", pi*r**2*h/3),2)
